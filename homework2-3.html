<h2>Playoff seeding change, tush push ban among 2025 NFL club playing rules, bylaw, resolution proposals</h2>


<div class="row">
  <div class="column" >
    <h2>Column 1</h2>
    <p>A potentially transformative set of rule proposals were submitted by a handful of NFL clubs on Wednesday.

        Perhaps the most significant is a proposal to revamp playoff seeding.
        
        Submitted by Detroit, the proposal would amend the current seeding format to allow wild-card qualifiers to be seeded above division champions if they finished with a better regular season record.
          
        The No. 1 overall seed would remain the division winner with the best record.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <h2>Column 2</h2>
    <p>The proposal also states that "if two or more playoff participants finish with the same won-lost-tied percentage at the end of the regular season, priority shall be given to a team or teams that are division champions."

        This change would have affected the most recent playoffs in four separate games on Wild Card Weekend. Instead of hosting the 11-6 Chargers on the opening weekend of the postseason, the 10-7 Texans would have traveled to Los Angeles to battle Jim Harbaugh's squad.
